# School Management System

A comprehensive school management system built with a microservices architecture, containerized with Docker, and deployed on Kubernetes. This system provides a robust platform for managing school operations efficiently.

## 🌟 Features

- Microservices-based architecture for scalability and maintainability
- Containerized applications using Docker
- Kubernetes orchestration for deployment
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins
- RESTful API endpoints for various school management operations

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Backend Service**
   - Core business logic and API endpoints
   - Database management
   - Authentication and authorization

2. **Microservice**
   - Specialized functionality
   - Independent scaling and deployment
   - Inter-service communication

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (Latest LTS version)
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud-based)
- Jenkins (for CI/CD)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd school-management-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Copy the contents from `.env.example` and update the values

## 🐳 Docker Setup

1. Build the backend image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t school-management-backend -f Dockerfile .
   ```

2. Build the microservice image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t school-management-microservice -f Dockerfile.microservice .
   ```

## ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

1. Apply the Kubernetes configurations:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/backend-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/microservice-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/nginx-ingress.yaml
   ```

2. Verify the deployments:
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get services
   ```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment:

1. **Pipeline Stages**:
   - Code checkout
   - Dependencies installation
   - Test execution
   - Docker image building
   - Image pushing to registry
   - Kubernetes deployment
   - Deployment verification

2. **Configuration**:
   - Jenkins pipeline is defined in `jenkins/Jenkinsfile`
   - Requires Docker registry credentials
   - Needs Kubernetes cluster access configuration

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

## 📚 API Documentation

API documentation will be available at `/api/docs` after starting the server.
